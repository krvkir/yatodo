#+TITLE: Yatodo

Yet another todo manager for Freeplane. Under construction.

* What's inside

Already here:
- Syncronization with ~todo.txt~ file
- Fancy icons for tasks and contexts (thanks [[https://icons8.com][Icons8]] -- here's the link you so much asked me to set!)

Planned:
- GTD map template with predefined styles for Next Actions, Done items, Someday items, Projects, icons for contexts and so on
- Shortcuts for common actions (toggle Next Action / Todo / Someday / no status)
- Archive and Someday in separate maps (prevents your main GTD map from bloating)
- Analytics of your performance
- Required and spent time assessing
